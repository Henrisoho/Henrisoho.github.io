                <p id="smmryBdy">My name is Henri Francois, I am a driven entrepreneur and expert team player. After spending time working in retail then home insurance I moved to a career in nightlife hosting the biggest clubs in Manhattan. While working in the hospitality scene a few friends and I noticed a stark lack of affordable branding and marketing solutions for restaurants and nightclubs, thus first look New York was born. Since 2020 we have been working to bring small business around New York easy understandable and most importantly budget friendly digital marketing strategy and branding solutions.</p>

It was a passion and hobby turned business that ended in 2021 when I went back to school.</p>
